                    <!--About-me Sub-header-->
                    My name is Bryan Hughes, I'm 28 years old and I was born and raised in
                    Mississauga, ON.
                    Before I came to Humber, I was a carpenter by trade. I owned a very small
                    interior renovation company. I didn't get a lot of work, but I was profitable when I did. Outside of my company, I would work for renovators
                    installing trim (baseboard, casing, moldings), doors/windows, hardwood
                    floors, floor/wall tile, etc. I really do love that work, but I was unable
                    to establish an equilibrium. I went to Seneca in Fall of 2019 for Computer Programming & Analysis in an attempt to break out of carpentry and into another field. I found a similar love for programming that I had found for carpentry. It's principles are very much inline with one another, and the ability to feel dignified by the work is also possible.

                    <!--Programming Background Sub-header-->
                    Before I went to Seneca in 2019, I had very little experience in
                    writing some HTML/CSS. I had bought Jon Duckett's book on HTML/CSS, in an
                    attempt to self-teach. I didn't know the difference between HTML and C.
                    In a lot of ways, Seneca was an absolute nightmare. But, I did gain a
                    mental model of the relationship the code shares. My understanding is that without going straight into machine code (Assembly), C programming
                    language is the lowest level language (over 3 million lines in the Curiosity Rover), created by Bell Labs in the 50's. Then there is C++, the child of C, but not C. Created by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stroustrup.com/">Bjarne Stroustrup</a>. Python is a product of C programming language, created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, and Javascript is a product of C++, created by Brendan Eich in 1995. As each of these languages abstracts certain tasks for you, you gain convenience, but sacrifice the speed of your programs. HTML is fundamentally different as a language. HTML contains no programming logic. It's used for structure. I am very much a student, I have <strong>a lot</strong> to learn about modern applications of code, but I'd like to think that my principles are intact. I wrote a website, based on my company, to practice a full-stack application. You can check it out <a target="blank" href="https://www.hughesbuildingcompany.ca">here</a>. It sucks on Mozilla, and the picture is not meant for mobile, but I think it has potential as product and definitely as a learning opportunity. I got stuck at sending the form data to the server. I can write C, I wrote a functional contact management system for a final project. I'm building a blog based on the things I love called 'The Fort'. What I'm trying to say is that I have a fair amount of experience in grade school level code. Nothing enterprise. I'm very excited to be in this program, it's tremendously more focused than the Seneca program and so far the professors here are fantastic.
